Demographic data for this final project was collected from adults 50+ with a clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment. All data has been deidentified. The dataset is called "demographic data." It is an Excel file, so it must be saved and read into RStudio using the read_excel function.
There are 30 objects and 9 variables in this dataset
This dataset includes Patient ID, Age, Cohort, Race/Ethnicity, Marital Status, Level of Education, Date of Birth, Gender, and Income.
Table One is stratified by Cohort and includes Age, Race_Ethnicity, Gender, Marital_Status, Level_of_Education, and Income
Any other column names that are referenced in the dataset might need to be renamed because it appears there were some extra spaces in the column names within the excel file.
A univariate regression was run using variables Race_Ethnicity, Gender, Marital_Status, Level_of_Education, and Income by Age
A histogram was created to show the age distribution withing the new cohorts
The meadian age of each cohort was also calculated
